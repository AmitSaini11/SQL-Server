The MERGE statement is a powerful and efficient tool available in various database systems (like SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL) that combines the functionalities
of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations into a single statement. It allows you to perform these operations on a target table based on the results of a join with a source table.

Key Features and Syntax:

INSERT: Inserts new rows into the target table based on the source table data that doesn't have a matching row in the target table.
UPDATE: Updates existing rows in the target table based on the source table data where there's a match according to the join condition.
DELETE: Deletes rows from the target table that no longer have a corresponding row in the source table.

Syntax:
SQL
MERGE INTO target_table AS t
USING source_table AS s
ON <join_condition>
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET <update_clause>
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (<column_list>) VALUES (<source_column_list>)
DELETE WHERE <delete_condition>;

Explanation:

MERGE INTO specifies the target table.
USING joins the target table with the source table.
ON defines the join condition between the target and source tables.
WHEN MATCHED THEN defines actions to be performed on matching rows (updates).
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN defines actions to be performed on non-matching rows (inserts).
DELETE WHERE specifies conditions for deleting rows from the target table.

Example :- 

-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE Products_Source (
    P_ID INT,
    P_Name VARCHAR(255),
    P_Price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Insert 10 records
INSERT INTO Products_Source(P_ID, P_Name, P_Price) VALUES
(1, 'Product 1', 10.99),
(2, 'Product 2', 20.49),
(3, 'Product 3', 15.75),
(4, 'Product 4', 8.99),
(5, 'Product 5', 12.50),
(6, 'Product 6', 18.25);

--- target 
-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE Products_Target (
    P_ID INT,
    P_Name VARCHAR(255),
    P_Price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Insert 10 records
INSERT INTO Products_Target (P_ID, P_Name, P_Price) VALUES
(1, 'Product 1', 10.99),
(2, 'Product 2', 20.49),
(3, 'Product 3', 15.75),
(4, 'Product 4', 8.99),
(5, 'Product 5', 12.50),
(6, 'Product 6', 18.25),
(7, 'Product 7', 22.99),
(8, 'Product 8', 9.99);

select * from Products_Source
select * from Products_Target

MERGE into Products_Target as trg
using Products_Source as src
ON (trg.P_ID = src.P_ID)
when not matched by target
then
Insert(P_ID,P_Name, P_Price)
values(src.P_ID,src.P_Name,src.P_Price)
when Matched then update
set trg.P_Name=src.P_Name,trg.P_Price =src.P_Price
when not matched by source
then delete;
