In MySQL Server, the GROUP BY clause is a powerful tool used for data aggregation and summarization within your SELECT statements. It allows you to group rows 
based on shared values in one or more columns and then perform aggregate functions (like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) on those groups.

Benefits of Using GROUP BY:

Data Summarization: Enables you to condense large datasets into meaningful summaries, focusing on trends and patterns instead of individual rows.
Improved Readability: Makes complex queries easier to understand by organizing data into well-defined groups.
Enhanced Analysis: Provides a foundation for various data analysis tasks by grouping data based on relevant criteria.

SQL Having Clause

Having clause utilize in SQL As a conditional clause with Group By Clause.
Having clause restricts the data on the group records rather than individual records.
A query may have the clauses (Where havinng clause).
Where clause Applied first and then Having Clause.

Difference between where and Having Clause

  Where Clause                                         Having Clause
- Where Clause Filter the rows                         Having Clause filters the whole group.   
- Where Clause can not contain                         Having Clausecan contain Aggregate function.
  Aggregate function.      
- Where clause selects the data before grouping        Having Clause selects the data after grouping
- Where clause can be used without Group By clause     Having Clause can not be used without Group By clause


-- Create the Employee table

GROUP BY DeptID, JoinYear
ORDER BY DeptID;

-- Where Clause
-- Find the total Salary, Average Salary in Department 1 & 3 .
Select DeptID,SUM(Salary)AS TotalSalary from Test3
Where DeptID in (101,104)
Group by DeptID

--- Having Clause
Select DeptID,SUM(Salary)AS TotalSalary from Test3
Where DeptID in (101,104)
Group by DeptID
Having Sum(Salary) > 50000
