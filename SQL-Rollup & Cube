SQL-Rollup & Cube:-

In MySQL Server, ROLLUP and CUBE are extensions to the GROUP BY clause that allow you to generate subtotals and totals across multiple dimensions of your dataset.
The Group By clause is used to Group the results of Aggregate Functions According to a Specified column using SUM(),AVG() etc.
However, the Group By clause doesn't perform Aggregate operations on multiple levels of a hierachy.
Generally CUBE and ROLLUP are used for repoting purposes.

ROLLUP: The ROLLUP operation generates subtotals for each level of grouping specified in the GROUP BY clause, from the most detailed level to the grand total. It produces a result set that includes all possible combinations of the columns in the GROUP BY clause.

CUBE: The CUBE operation generates subtotals for all possible combinations of columns specified in the GROUP BY clause. It produces a result set that includes all possible combinations of the columns, including the grand total.

ROLLUP:- Rollup operators let you extend the functionality of Group By Clauses by Calculating subtotatls and Grand totals for a set of columns.

Example:- 

CREATE TABLE SalesData2 (
    ProductID INT,
    Region VARCHAR(50),
    Year INT,
    Sales DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
INSERT INTO SalesData2 (ProductID, Region, Year, Sales) VALUES
(1, 'North', 2021, 1000.00),
(1, 'North', 2022, 1500.00),
(1, 'North', 2023, 2000.00),
(2, 'North', 2021, 1200.00),
(2, 'North', 2022, 1800.00),
(2, 'North', 2023, 2200.00),
(1, 'South', 2021, 800.00),
(1, 'South', 2022, 1300.00),
(1, 'South', 2023, 1900.00),
(2, 'South', 2021, 1000.00),
(2, 'South', 2022, 1500.00),
(2, 'South', 2023, 2000.00),
(3, 'North', 2021, 1500.00),
(3, 'North', 2022, 2000.00),
(3, 'North', 2023, 2500.00);

select * From SalesData2
-- Normal 
Select Year,SUM(Sales) from SalesData2 Group By Year 
-- Using Rollup  
Select Year,SUM(Sales) from SalesData2 Group By Rollup(Year);
-- Using COALESCE
SELECT COALESCE(CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), Year), 'Number') AS YearOrNumber, 
       SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales 
FROM SalesData2 
GROUP BY ROLLUP(Year);
-- Using COALESCE MUltiple column
Select COALESCE(Convert(varchar(10),year),'Number')As YearOrNumber,ProductID,
       SUM(Sales)AS TotalSales 
FROM SalesData2 
GROUP BY ROLLUP(Year,ProductID);

SQL CUBE:-
The CUBE operator is similar in Functionality to the ROLLUP Operator,However, the CUBE Operator can calculate subtotals and Grand Totals for All permutations of 
the columns specified in it.
The CUBE Operator is also used in combination with the GROUP BY clause, however, the CUBE operator produces results by Generating all combinations of
columns specified in the Group By clause.

Example:-

Select COALESCE(Convert(varchar(10), year), 'Number')As YearOrNumber, ProductID,
       SUM(Sales)AS TotalSales 
FROM SalesData2 
GROUP BY CUBE(Year,ProductID);
