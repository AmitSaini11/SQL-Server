In SQL Server, a subquery is a query nested within another query. The result of the subquery is used by the outer query to perform further operations such as 
filtering, joining, or aggregating data. Subqueries allow you to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts.

There are three types of subqueries:

Single-row subquery: A subquery that returns only one row of result. It can be used wherever a single value is expected in the outer query.

Multiple-row subquery: A subquery that returns multiple rows of result. It can be used wherever a list of values is expected in the outer query.

Correlated subquery: A subquery that references one or more columns from the outer query. The subquery is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query.

-- Create the Employees table
CREATE TABLE Test4 (
    EmpID INT,
    EmpName VARCHAR(255),
    DeptID INT,
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert records into the Employees table
INSERT INTO Test4 (EmpID, EmpName, DeptID, Salary) VALUES
(1, 'John', 101, 50000.00),
(2, 'Jane', 102, 60000.00),
(3, 'Alice', 101, 55000.00),
(4, 'Bob', 103, 52000.00),
(5, 'Eva', 102, 58000.00);

Select * from Test4
-- Single-row subquery:
-- Example: Find the employee with the highest salary
SELECT EmpName, Salary
FROM Test4
WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Test4);

-- Multiple-row subquery:
-- Example: Find employees in the same department as employee 'John'
Select EmpName,DeptID From Test4
Where DeptID in(select DeptID From Test4 Where EmpName = 'John')

-- Correlated subquery:
-- Example: Find employees who earn more than the average salary in their department
SELECT EmpName, Salary
FROM Test4 t
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Test4 WHERE DeptID = t.DeptID);

--- Find the employee with the highest salary
SELECT EmpName, Salary 
FROM Test4 
WHERE Salary NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT Salary 
    FROM Test4 
    WHERE Salary >= '999999'
)
-- Example: Find employees with a salary greater than any employee in the same department as employee 'John'
SELECT EmpName
FROM Test4
WHERE Salary > ANY (SELECT Salary FROM Test4 WHERE DeptID IN 
                   (SELECT DeptID FROM Test4 WHERE EmpName = 'John'));
