SQL Set Opertors

The SQL Set Opertion is used to combine the two or more SQL select statements.
The set operators look similar to SQL joins although there is a big difference.
SQL joins tends to combine columns from difference tables, where as SQL set operators co mbine rows from distinct queries.

Rules on set Operations

The results sets of all queries must have the same number of columns.
In every reult set the data type of each column must match the data types of its corresponding column in the first result set.
In order to sort the result an order by clause sholud be part of the last statement.
The records from the top query must match the positional ordering of the records from the bottom query.

Four Set Opertors

Union :- Combine two or more result sets into a single set without duplicates.
Union All :- Combine two or more result sets into a single set, including all duplicates.
Intersect :- Takes the data from both result sets which are in common.
Except :- Takes the data from first result set, but not the second(no matching each other)


CREATE TABLE Test1 (
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    MobileNo VARCHAR(15),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    Occupation VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO Test1 (Name, MobileNo, City, Occupation, Salary) VALUES
('John Doe', '1234567890', 'New York', 'Software Engineer', 75000.00),
('Jane Smith', '9876543210', 'Los Angeles', 'Data Scientist', 85000.00),
('Bob Johnson', '5678901234', 'Chicago', 'Marketing Manager', 65000.00),
('John Doe duplicate', '1234567890', 'New York', 'Software Engineer', 90000.00),
('Jane Smith duplicate', '9876543210', 'Los Angeles', 'Data Scientist', 95000.00),
('Alice Johnson duplicate', '555123-4567', 'Chicago', 'Marketing Manager', 80000.00);

-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE Test2 (
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    MobileNo VARCHAR(20),
    City VARCHAR(100),
    Occupation VARCHAR(100),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert sample values
INSERT INTO Test2 (Name, MobileNo, City, Occupation, Salary) VALUES
('John Doe', '123-456-7890', 'New York', 'Software Engineer', 90000.00),
