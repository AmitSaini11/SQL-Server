SQL Server Exixts Operator

The Exists opertor is a logical opertor that allows you to check whether a subquery returns any row.
The Exists opertor return s True if the subquery return one or more rows.
Exists is commonly used with correlated subqueries.

SQL Server Correlated Query
A correlated subquery is a subquery that depends on the outer query. It means that the Where clause of the correlated uses the data of the outer query.
SQL corrected Subqueries are used to select data from a table reference in the outer query.


Example :- Select *from employee emp where exists
           ( select from employee where empID = emp.empID and salary > 5000)

Note :- A correlated subquery executeonce for each selected row from the outer query.
        (Total Rows in Table * Total Rows in Table)

Sub-Query :- 
A subquery is a query nested within another query.
It can return a single value, a single row, multiple rows, or a result set.
Subqueries can be used in different parts of a SQL statement, such as the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.
Subqueries are executed independently of the outer query and are evaluated only once.
The result of the subquery is used by the outer query as a single value, a single row, or a set of rows.

Example:-

SELECT Name
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID
    FROM Orders
);

Correlated Subquery:

A correlated subquery is a type of subquery that references columns from the outer query within its WHERE clause.
It is executed for each row processed by the outer query.
The result of the correlated subquery may vary for each row of the outer query, as it depends on the values of the outer query's columns.
Correlated subqueries are used to filter or modify the results based on the values of the outer query.

Example:-

SELECT Name
FROM Customers AS c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Orders AS o
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
    AND o.OrderDate > '2023-01-01'
);


Feature	                  Subquery	                            Correlated Subquery	
Execution	          Once for the entire outer query	    Once for each row in the outer query	
Outer table reference	  No	                                    Yes (references a column)	
Complexity	          Simpler	                            More complex	
Performance	          Potentially faster	                    Potentially slower due to repeated execution
