CAST Function:
The CAST function is ANSI SQL standard and is used to explicitly convert an expression from one data type to another.
CAST is ANSI SQL standard and supported by most database systems, while CONVERT is specific to SQL Server.
CAST is supported across multiple database systems, making it more portable, while CONVERT is specific to SQL Server.

Example :- SELECT CAST('2024-02-23' AS DATE) AS ConvertedDate;

CONVERT Function:
The CONVERT function is specific to SQL Server (it's not ANSI SQL standard) and is used to convert an expression from one data type to another.
CONVERT allows an optional style parameter for certain data types, while CAST does not.

Example :- SELECT CONVERT(DATE, '2024-02-23') AS ConvertedDate;
