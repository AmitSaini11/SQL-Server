SQL While Loops

In SQL, the WHILE loop is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of SQL statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. WHILE loops are commonly used in SQL Server, but they may not be available in all database systems.

Example :-

-- SQL Server Loops
Declare @Count int;
set @Count = 1;
While @Count <= 5
Begin
     print @count;
	 set @count=@count+1;
END

----
CREATE PROCEDURE CalculateFactorial
    @Number INT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @Factorial BIGINT;
    DECLARE @Counter INT;

    -- Initialize variables
    SET @Factorial = 1;
    SET @Counter = 1;

    -- Loop until Counter reaches the given Number
    WHILE @Counter <= @Number
    BEGIN
        SET @Factorial = @Factorial * @Counter;
        SET @Counter = @Counter + 1;
    END;

    -- Print the factorial
    PRINT 'Factorial of ' + CAST(@Number AS VARCHAR) + ' is ' + CAST(@Factorial AS VARCHAR);
END;


EXEC CalculateFactorial @Number = 5;
